## Challenges Faced

- **TMDB API Access Issue**: The TMDB API wasnâ€™t working locally due to regional restrictionsâ€”we had to use a VPN to access it.
   Later, we realized the API worked fine in production, so we deployed the project on Vercel to test and confirm successful data fetching.

- **Seat Reservation & Auto-Release**: When a user selects seats, we temporarily lock them for 10 minutes to
  prevent others from booking the same ones. If the user doesnâ€™t confirm the booking within that time, the seats
 are automatically released using a background job powered by Inngest.
